502 Waiver Exam Page
====================

The following is the assessment for the 502 Waiver. This should take about 30 minutes to complete. It tests your understanding of the basic mechanics of:

* Assignment statements
* Conditional execution
* Indexing into strings and lists
* For loops
* Dictionaries

502 Waiver Exam
---------------

**Instructions:** For questions that ask you to write code, write code in the provided active code windows and click the Run button. Feel keep editing the code until you get feedback that you have passed the tests. The last code you run for each problem will be graded. Instructions are comments in the code windows. *Do not* hit **Finish Exam** until you are finished.

  # Create a variable called uni and assign it the value:
  # "University of Michigan"

  =====

  from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

  class myTests(TestCaseGui):

     def testOne(self):
        self.assertEqual(uni, "University of Michigan", "Checking value of variable uni")

  myTests().main()



.. mchoice:: waiver502_9
  :autograde: first_answer
  :answer_a: String
  :answer_b: List
  :answer_c: Dictionary
  :feedback_a: Because you took a slice, the resulting type will be a list.
  :feedback_b: Because you took a slice, the resulting type will be a list.
  :feedback_c: Because you took a slice, the resulting type will be a list.
  :correct: b

  After the following Python code is executed, what will be the type of L[4:5] if L = ['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']?


.. mchoice:: waiver502_11
  :autograde: first_answer
  :answer_a: 6
  :answer_b: 3
  :answer_c: False
  :answer_d: True
  :answer_e: None of the above, there will be an error.
  :feedback_a: First was compared against sec, not combined with sec + 1, it is still 3.
  :feedback_b: First still is assigned the value of 3, even after the comparison against sec + 1.
  :feedback_c: First is not reassigned the value of the comparison of first and sec + 1, which would have been True, not False, so first is still 3.
  :feedback_d: First is not reassigned the value of the comparison of first and sec + 1, so it cannot be True. First is still 3.
  :feedback_e: No error occurs, all of the lines are permissible in python.
  :correct: b

  What will print out at the end of this section of code?

  .. sourcecode:: python

     first = 3
     sec = 2
     first == sec + 1
     print first

.. mchoice:: waiver502_14
  :autograde: first_answer
  :answer_a: True
  :answer_b: False
  :answer_c: 'b'
  :answer_d: 4
  :answer_e: Error occurs
  :feedback_a: Using the in opperator on dictionaries checks the keys, so since 4 is not a key, it will return False.
  :feedback_b: Using the in opperator on dictionaries checks the keys, so since 4 is not a key, it will return False.
  :feedback_c: When using the in opperator on dictionaries, it checks the keys and would not find the 4. Additionally, the in opperator returns a boolean value, not the key associated with a value.
  :feedback_d: When using the in opperator on dictionaries, it checks the keys and would not find the 4. Additionally, the in opperator returns a boolean value, not the value it checks for.
  :feedback_e: The in opperator is permissible in python, and returns a boolean value.
  :correct: b

  What will print when this code is run?

  .. sourcecode:: python

     d = {}
     d['a'] = 5
     d['b'] = 4
     d[3] = 'b'
     print 4 in d

  :answer_b: You are just as late as you are tardy.
  :answer_c: You are more tardy than late.

  :feedback_b: Not quite!
  :feedback_c: Not quite!

  What will be printed?
