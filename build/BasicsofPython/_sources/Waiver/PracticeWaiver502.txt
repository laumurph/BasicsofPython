Practice Assessment for 502 Waiver
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The following is a practice assessment for the 502 Waiver. This should take about 30 minutes to complete. While this is not a timed assessment, the final assessment will have a time limit of 30 minutes, so keeping track of how long it takes will be a good indicator of long the final assessment will take you.

Everything in this chapter can be completed after reading the Basics of Python chapter on this site.

**Instructions:** For questions that require you to write code, write the code you want to save in the provided active code windows. Hidden test code will let you know if you passed or failed, but don't hardcode answers to pass the tests; answer the question as posed.

.. mchoicemf:: pwaiver_mc_1
   :answer_a: "Hello, world!"
   :answer_b: Hello, world!
   :answer_c: An error occurs, you have not initialized the type of the variable.
   :feedback_a: When printing a string, the quotes are not included in the output.
   :feedback_b: When printing a string, the quotes are not included in the output.
   :feedback_c: Python does not require that you initialize your variable's type.
   :correct: b

   What is the output when this code is run?

   .. sourcecode:: python

      first_prog = "Hello, world!"
      print first_prog

.. mchoicemf:: pwaiver_mc_2
   :multiple_answers:
   :answer_a: var[2]
   :answer_b: var[2:3]
   :answer_c: var["g"]
   :answer_d: var[-8]
   :feedback_a: This refers to the substring "g".
   :feedback_b: This refers to the substring "g", not "g ", because the slice goes up to but does include position 3
   :feedback_c: An Error occurs because when indexing, you must use the numerical position.
   :feedback_d: This refers to the substring "g".
   :correct: a,b,d

   Which of these are equivalent? (Choose all that apply)

   .. sourcecode:: python

      var = "Big House!"

.. mchoicemf:: pwaiver_mc_3
   :answer_a: 13
   :answer_b: 14
   :answer_c: 16
   :answer_d: 18
   :answer_e: An Error occurs, incorrect use of len function.
   :feedback_a: Spaces and periods are counted as characters when using the len function.
   :feedback_b: Spaces and periods are counted as characters when using the len function.
   :feedback_c: There are 16 characters.
   :feedback_d: Hmm, where did you get the extra 2 characters from?
   :feedback_e: The len function returns the number of characters in a string.
   :correct: c

   What output will be produced by the following code?

   .. sourcecode:: python

      sentence = "Welcome to UMSI."
      print len(sentence)

.. mchoicemf:: pwaiver_mc_4

   :feedback_b: Lists use [] as brackets, not ().
   :feedback_c: We use them in order to call or invoke a function.
   :feedback_d: Dictionaries use {} as brackets, not ().
   :correct: a,c

   Where can you use ``()`` in programming so far? (choose all that apply)

Extract the value from the 5th position in the list (the sublist beginning ["Hello", 9.4]) into a variable called ``abc``.

.. activecode:: pwaiver_a_1 
   :nocodelens:

   zxy = [1, 2, 30, "sims", ["Hello", 9.4, "World", "python"], 502, 506]

   =====

   from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

   class myTests(TestCaseGui):

      def testOne(self):
         self.assertEqual(abc, ["Hello", 9.4, "World", "python"], "Testing whether abc has the right value.")

   myTests().main()

.. parsonsprob:: pwaiver_pp_1
   
   Arrange the following code snippets into the correct order. The variable new_class is assumed to have already been assigned a value. If it's 506 or more, then it should print "You might be going into 506." If new_class is smaller than 502, it print "Have you applied to the school?" Otherwise, it should print "This is the waiver."

   -----
   if new_class >= 506:
   =====
       print "You might be going to 506."
   =====
   elif new_class < 502:
   =====
       print "Have you applied to the school?"
   =====
   else:
   =====
       print "This is the waiver."

.. mchoicemf:: pwaiver_mc_5
   :answer_a: False
   :answer_b: True
   :feedback_a: You can have an if statement that does not have an elif and/or else.
   :feedback_b: You can have an if statement that does not have an elif and/or else.
   :correct: b

   True or false: you may have an if statement without a corresponding else clause or elif clause.

.. mchoicemf:: pwaiver_mc_6
   :multiple_answers:
   :answer_a: num = num + 1
   :answer_b: num ++
   :answer_c: num ++ 1
   :answer_d: num += 1
   :feedback_a: correct, num would be reassigned the value of num plus 1.
   :feedback_b: This is not permissible in python, an Error would occur.
   :feedback_c: This is not permissible in python, an Error would occur.
   :feedback_d: correct, num would be reassigned the value of num plus 1.
   :correct: a,d

   Which snippet of code would increment the value of ``num`` by one? (choose all that apply)

Using the variable ``wrds``, how might you grab the last seven characters of a string? Save the last 7 characters of ``wrds`` in a variable called ``plc`` so that when plc is printed out, the output would be: States.

.. activecode:: pwaiver_a_2
   :nocodelens:

   wrds = "Summer is a warm time of year in the United States."

   =====

   from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

   class myTests(TestCaseGui):

      def testOne(self):
         self.assertEqual(plc, wrds[-7:], "Checking the value of plc.")

   myTests().main()

.. parsonsprob:: pwaiver_pp_2

   Organize the code snippets so that if the string "venmo" is an element of the list, then it prints out True, and otherwise, it print False.

   -----
   lst = ["I use venmo", 
         "I owe my friend 10 dollars for pizza", 10, 
         {"pizza": 10, "burger": -7.59, "park": -2.25}]
   =====
   if "venmo" in lst:
   =====
      print True
   =====
   else:
   =====
      print False

.. mchoicemf:: pwaiver_mc_7
   :answer_a: 1
   :answer_b: 4
   :answer_c: 5
   :answer_d: 8
   :feedback_a: The last element is a list, so the len function returns the length of that list.
   :feedback_b: We are using len on a single element of the list lst_test, so it will only be the len of that element, not the whole list.
   :feedback_c: We are using len on the last element of the list which is four!
   :feedback_d: Since we are using negative indicies, we will not use "Good-bye", we will use the last element, which is the list [10, 9, [], "good night"]
   :correct: b

   What is the output of this program?

   
   .. sourcecode:: python

      lst_test = ["Hello", "Good-bye", "Good day", 35.9, [10, 9, [], "good night"]]
      print len(lst_test[-1])

Using the two variables listed, combine them together and save that in a variable called ``combo`` so that if combo was printed, the resulting string would be "The arb was a great place to vist this week!"

.. activecode:: pwaiver_a_3
   :nocodelens:

   place = "The arb was a great place "
   feel = "to visit this week!"

   =====

   from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

      def testOne(self):
         self.assertEqual(combo, place + feel, "Checking the value of combo.")

   myTests().main()

.. mchoicemf:: pwaiver_mc_8
   :answer_a: len(range(hbe))
   :answer_b: range(len(hbe))
   :answer_c: range(15)
   :answer_d: range() = hbe
   :answer_e: range(hbe)
   :feedback_a: range expects a number as input, not a string.
   :feedback_b: This will produce a list that contains elements between 0 and 15.
   :feedback_c: This is an example of why it's better not to hardcode a number when you can have python compute it. There are actually 16 characters in the string.
   :feedback_d: This would cause an error because it attempts to assign, to a function call, the value of a string. That is not permitted in Python.
   :feedback_e: range expects a number as input, not a string.
   :correct: b

   Which snippet of code would produce a list of numbers with as many elements as the string hbe?

   .. sourcecode:: python

      hbe = "Python is great."

.. parsonsprob:: pwaiver_pp_3

   Organize the code snippets so that "Go blue!" and "Go maize!" are printed out alternately, 4 times.

   -----
   wow = "Go blue!"
   =====
   for i in range(4):
   =====
      print wow
   =====
      print "Go maize!"

   :multiple_answers:
   :answer_a: True
   :answer_b: true
   :answer_c: False
   :answer_d: false
   :feedback_a: True with a capital T is the boolean value.
   :feedback_b: True with a lowercase t is not a boolean, it's a variable in this case.
   :feedback_c: False with a capital F is the boolean value.
   :feedback_d: False with a lowercase f is not a boolean, it's a variable in this case.
   :correct: a,c

   Which are the boolean values? (Choose all that apply)

Print the length of each element in the list, using a for loop.

.. activecode:: pwaiver_a_4
   :nocodelens:

   vals = ["Python", "summer time", "Hello World!", "onomonopia", "Floccinaucinihilipilification", "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious", "wheel", "copyright", "fall", "School of Information"]

   =====

   print "There are no tests for this. Your output should be 6\n11\..."


.. mchoicemf:: pwaiver_mc_10
   :answer_a: dict = value[key]
   :answer_b: dict[key] = value
   :answer_c: dict = key[value]
   :answer_d: dict[value] = key
   :feedback_a: In order to create a new key value pair, the key must be next to the dictionary on the left side in order to reference the value and the value must be on the right side of the assignment statement.
   :feedback_b: The key is used on the left side of the assignment statement and the value is on the right side of the assignment statement.
   :feedback_c: In order to create a new key value pair, the key must be next to the dictionary on the left side in order to reference the value and the value must be on the right side of the assignment statement.
   :feedback_d: In order to create a new key value pair, the key must be on the right side of the assignment statement because it is used to reference the value, which is on the left side of the assignment statement.
   :correct: b

   How can you add a new key value pair to a dictionary?

.. mchoicemf:: pwaiver_mc_11
   :answer_a: a numeric index
   :answer_b: a key
   :answer_c: a function call
   :feedback_a: Numeric indices are used for things like strings and lists, but not for dictionaries.
   :feedback_b: Dictionaries use keys to access their information.
   :feedback_c: Function calls are not a way to access a dicitonary, they are used to use a function.
   :correct: b

   How are dictionaries accessed?

Create a dictionary called ``extra`` that has the key-value pairs: "Black" and "White", 14.9 and 0, "milkshake" and 390, and 29 and an empty list.

.. activecode:: pwaiver_a_5
   :nocodelens:

   =====

   from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

   class myTests(TestCaseGui):

      def testOne(self):
         self.assertEqual(sorted(extra), sorted({"Black": "White", 14.9: 0, "milkshake": 390, 29: []}), "Checking whether extra has the right keys.")
         self.assertEqual(sorted(extra.values()), sorted(["White", 0, 390, []]), "Checking whether extra has the right values.")


   myTests().main()


.. mchoicemf:: pwaiver_mc_12
   :answer_a: the last value
   :answer_b: the last key
   :answer_c: all the values
   :answer_d: all the keys
   :answer_e: the word item
   :feedback_a: This will print out all of the keys, not just a single value.
   :feedback_b: This will print out all of the keys, not just the last one, because the print statement is indented as part of the for loop.
   :feedback_c: Iteration on a dictionary is implicitly iteration on the keys, not the values.
   :feedback_d: item refers to a different key in the dictionary on each iteration.
   :feedback_e: item is not a string this case; it is a variable that refers to the keys in the dictionary.
   :correct: d

   What part of a dictionary is printed out by the following statements?

   .. sourcecode:: python

      mydict = {True: False, "lol": "laugh out loud",
               "bark": 2, 40; 20, 
               "wonderful: ["incredible", "fabulous", "awful nice"]}
      for item in mydict:
         print item

Create a list of numbers starting at 15 and goes to 145 and assign that to a variable called ``big_lst``.

   :answer_e: An Error occurs.
   :feedback_a: a is reassigned the value produced by the statement b == 10, which checks equivalency and is thus True.
   :feedback_b: a is reassigned the value produced by the statement b == 10, which checks equivalency and is thus True because b has been reassigned the value of a (which was 10).
   :feedback_c: a is reassigned the value produced by the statement b == 10, which checks equivalency and is thus True because b has been reassigned the value of a (which had been 10 earlier).
   :feedback_d: a is reassigned the value produced by the statement b == 10, which checks equivalency and is thus True because b has been reassigned the value of a (which had been 10 earlier).
   :feedback_e: This code does not produce an error in Python.
   :correct: a

   What prints out when this code is run?

   :answer_a: Yes, indentation can change the meaning of a program.
   :answer_b: It helps so that programs look nice and organized, but has no effect on the execution of the program.
   :answer_c: No, indentation is not important or necessary in Python.
   :feedback_a: Indentation is necessary in Python. In fact, errors occur when necessary indentation is not included. 
   :feedback_b: Indentation marks the beginning and ends of code blocks for if statements and for loops, among other things.
   :feedback_c: Indentation marks the beginning and ends of code blocks for if statements and for loops, among other things.
