502 Waiver Exam Page
====================


The following is the assessment for the 502 Waiver. This should take about 30 minutes to complete. Content based on the first few chapters will include:

* Assignment Statements
* Conditional Statements
* Indexing
* For Loops
* Dictionaries


502 Waiver Exam
---------------

**Instructions:** For questions that ask you to write code, write the code you want to save in the provided active code windows. The last code you have saved for each problem by the deadline is what will be graded. Instructions are comments in the code window. *Do not* hit **Finish Exam** until you are finished.

      :answer_b: The elements of the list produced by the range function call.
      :answer_c: Nothing, that is an improper use of a for loop.
      :feedback_a: The only input that the range function needs is between the parenthesis in the function call, item is not used for that.
      :feedback_b: Elem represents each element in the list that is created by the range function call.

      :feedback_a: Not quite right, you are allowed to have dictionaries and lists inside of other lists and dictionaries.
      :feedback_b: Yes, there is no assignment statement, thus there is no way to use the dictionary later on.
      :feedback_c: Yes, some of the values and keys that are supposed to be strings are missing quotes around them, thus the dictionary will think that they are missing variables and cause an error.
      :feedback_d: Yes, there is a comma missing, which would cause an error when trying to run. Syntax is important to running programs.

      :answer_a: Yes, you can index into a dictionary by using their positions.
      :answer_b: Yes, you can index into a dictionary because they are like lists, just with {} brackets instead of [] ones. 
      :answer_c: No, you cannot index into a dictionary because they do not have positions.
      :answer_d: No, you cannot index into a dictionary because the {} brackets are different than then [] ones.
      :feedback_a: Dictionaries don't have positions that you can use to index.
      :feedback_b: Dictionaries aren't quite like lists, they are unordered whereas lists are ordered.
